<!-- 
    There are eight basic data types in JavaScript.
    1.Number:
        It represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        e.g:let n = 123;
            n = 12.345;
    2.BigInt:
        It is used to represent large integer value
        e.g:const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    3.String
        A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
        e.g:let str = "Hello";
    4.Boolean (logical type):
        The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
        e.g:let nameFieldChecked = true;        
            let ageFieldChecked = false;
    5.The “null” value:
        The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
        e.g:let a=null;
    6.The “undefined” value:
        The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
        e.g:let age;
            alert(age); // shows "undefined"
    7.Objects and Symbols:
        The object type is special.
        The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
    8.The typeof operator:
        The typeof operator returns the type of the argument.
         It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.
         It supports two forms of syntax:
            1.As an operator: typeof x.
            2.As a function: typeof(x).
